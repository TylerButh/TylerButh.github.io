        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2001, Metro Louisville Youth Association, Inc. (MLYA or Metro) has provided our community with junior football league play in Louisville’s West End.  As the organization approaches its third decade of offering nonprofit programming for the city’s most vulnerable young people, MLYA is determined to expand programming to more participants, neighborhoods, and do so with additional services which truly impact the educational attainment and safe and healthy living of our youth.  Affiliations between the organization and its member site clusters, independently owned and operated, lead to the durability and longevity of MLYA programming.  Estimates are that the league reaches over 2000 youth each year.</p>
        <h2>Board Member</h2>
        <p>We are currently looking for one more board member to join our team. It is a volunteer position that requires leadership.</p>
        <h2>Please Support!</h2>
        <p>While the coaches and management are volunteers running a league still has a lot of costs, government fees, equipment, insurance, field rentals, uniforms, etc. If you can help please think about donating any amount, small or big. We've created a starting goal we'd like to reach though to make sure we can afford this next year. ‘Metro is a 501(c)(3), gifts are tax deductible.</p>

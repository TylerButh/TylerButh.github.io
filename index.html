        <p>Founded in 2001, Metro Louisville Youth Association, Inc. (MLYA or Metro) has provided our community with junior football league play in Louisville’s West End.  As the organization approaches its third decade of offering nonprofit programming for the city’s most vulnerable young people, MLYA is determined to expand programming to more participants, neighborhoods, and do so with aditional services which truly impact the educational attainment and safe and healthy living of our youth.  Affiliations between the organization and its member site clusters, independently owned and operated, lead to the durability and longevity of MLYA programming.  Estimates are that the league reaches over 2000 youth each year.</p>
